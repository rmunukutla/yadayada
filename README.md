# Issues
- Add in the symbols $ and % in input (and general formatting) when user is not editing that input box

- Darken rest of screen when removal overlay is open

- Make input cards take up less space (flex-wrap, div the label and the input)

# Future Work
- NEXT PAGE: Change the edit function, so that it updates all the output cards to input cards (e.g. Paysa Profile)

# Completed

- Have a link to click that pulls up the dropdown box, when that link is clicked try to submit all input forms, if they submit correctly, then the dropdown appears and the user can add another card.

- No edit button when in input mode.

- Remove term for payday loan and put "Original Loan Date" with date input and date picker

- Add overlay to confirm removal, No add button, "Remove" instead of "Change"
