# Issues
- Add in the symbols $ and % in input (and general formatting) when user is not editing that input box

- Add overlay to confirm removal, removal button instead of add button

- Remove term for payday loan and put original date with data input and date picker

- Adding cards, once card is completed, check if its valid and complete it but keep it still in input, and then allow the user to add another card as long as all other cards are completed.

- No edit button when in input mode.

- NEXT PAGE: Change the edit function, so that it updates all the output cards to input cards (e.g. Paysa Profile)
