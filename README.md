- Add in the symbols $ and % in input (and general formatting) when user is not editing that input box

- Add overlay to confirm removal, No add button, "Remove" instead of "Change"

- Remove term for payday loan and put "Original Loan Date" with date input and date picker

- Adding cards, once card is completed, check if its valid and complete it but keep it still in input, and then allow the user to add another card as long as all other cards are completed. 

- Add the dropdown when all the other input boxes are complete that says "Add Another Source"

- No edit button when in input mode.
